Got it 👍 — your `README.md` is the file that describes your project on GitHub. Right now, you probably only have this line inside it:

```markdown
# Black-Pink-White-Page-Project
```

That works, but it’s very basic. You can make it look much nicer so when someone visits your repo, they understand what it’s about.

## ✨ Example `README.md` for your project

Here’s a template you can copy into your `README.md`:

This is a simple web project created during my internship.  
It demonstrates the use of **black, pink, and white** color combinations in a responsive page layout.
